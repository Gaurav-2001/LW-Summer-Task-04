# Image Processing with Python 🐍

## Task Description 📄

**🔅 Task 4.1**
📌 Create image by yourself Using Python Code

**🔅 Task 4.2**
📌 Take 2 image crop some part of both image and swap it.

**🔅 Task 4.3**
📌 Take 2 image and combine it to form single image. For example collage

### Now Before moving ahead with the Task lets first understand what is Image Processing

Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it.

It is the core part of computer vision which plays a crucial role in many real-world examples like robotics, self-driving cars, and object detection. Image processing allows us to transform and manipulate thousands of images at a time and extract useful insights from them. It has a wide range of applications in almost every field.

Python is one of the widely used programming languages for this purpose. Its amazing libraries and tools help in achieving the task of image processing very efficiently.

### OpenCV an Image processing tool in Python

It stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library. This library consists of around 2000+ optimized algorithms that are useful for computer vision and machine learning. There are several ways you can use OpenCV in image processing, a few are listed below:
* Converting images from one color space to another i.e. like between BGR and HSV, BGR and gray etc.
* Performing thresholding on images, like, simple thresholding, adaptive thresholding etc.
* Smoothing of images, like, applying custom filters to images and blurring of images.
* Performing morphological operations on images.
* Building image pyramids.
* Extracting foreground from images using GrabCut algorithm.
* Image segmentation using watershed algorithm.

.. and many more

>Now Here For Performing all these task we are going to use OpenCV Library of python
